This change in state allows the refrigerator to absorb heat from the inside of the fridge and release it outside.  Here's a simple explanation:\n\n1. **Refrigerant is chilled:** The refrigerant is circulated through a system of tubes and coils. A compressor pumps the refrigerant, which is initially liquid, into the coils. The coils are located inside the refrigerator, where they come into contact with the cold air inside. \n2. **Heat absorption:** The", "alpha": 12.0, "layer": 18}
